# Thesis Copilot — Build log

Append-only. One section per unit, one entry per task. Newest at the bottom.
Evidence is a pasted command and its trimmed output — never a description (PRD §0.3 rule 2).

- Notes / deviations from PRD:
  - Toolchain checked before pinning (§0.3 rule 1). Node v24.18.0, pnpm 9.15.9, Docker 29.5.3.
  - Versions pinned to the newest release inside each major the PRD fixes in §7.2:
    Next 15.5.25, React 19.2.0, NestJS 11.2.3, Fastify 5.12.3, Prisma 6.19.3, TypeScript 5.9.3,
    Biome 2.5.12, Turborepo 2.10.12, Vitest 4.1.11, Tailwind 4.3.3, BullMQ 5.81.4, zod 4.5.4.
    Newer majors exist (TypeScript 7, Next 16, NestJS 12, Prisma 8, vitest 5) and were NOT taken:
    §7.2 fixes the majors and §0.3 rule 6 says prefer boring. Changing a major needs an ADR.
  - `ai` 7.0.92 + `@ai-sdk/anthropic` 4.0.49 declare peer `zod: ^3.25.76 || ^4.1.8`; zod 4.5.4 satisfies it.
  - Dev Compose ports are shifted off the defaults (Postgres 5434, Redis 6381, MinIO 9002/9003,
    Gotenberg 3002) because this machine already runs other projects' containers on 5432/6379/9000.
  - `pnpm install` prints a node-gyp warning for `ssh2` (an optional native crypto binding pulled in by
    testcontainers). It is optional, the install completes, and testcontainers falls back to pure JS.

### Task 0.2 — `CLAUDE.md` and docs
- Status: DONE
- Evidence:
  ```
  $ wc -l CLAUDE.md
  101 CLAUDE.md                      # limit is 150 (PRD §0 rule 7)

  $ diff <(sed -n '1831,1936p' docs/PRD.md) <(tail -n +11 docs/ADR/0001-editor.md) \
      && echo "VERBATIM MATCH OK"
  VERBATIM MATCH OK — Appendix B copied byte-for-byte

  $ ls docs docs/ADR fixtures/papers
  docs:     ADR  BUILD_LOG.md  CONSISTENCY_REVIEW.md  PHASES.md  PRD.md
  docs/ADR: 0001-editor.md
  fixtures/papers: README.md
  ```
- Notes / deviations from PRD:
  - The two spec files were delivered as `PRD_1.md` and `PHASES.md` at the repo root; moved to
    `docs/PRD.md` and `docs/PHASES.md` so the paths in PHASES.md's own start prompts resolve.
  - `docs/CONSISTENCY_REVIEW.md` is the discrepancy log required by PHASES.md's preamble
    ("the PRD wins and the discrepancy is logged"). It lists 11 places where the PRD contradicts
    itself and PHASES had to pick a side. These need human decisions; none block Phase 0.
  - Added `.gitattributes` with `* text=auto eol=lf`. Reason: this is a Windows checkout and the
    Appendix A prompt files must stay byte-identical to the PRD (§0.3 rule 11); CRLF churn would
    break that.
