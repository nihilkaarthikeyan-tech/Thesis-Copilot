- Notes / deviations from PRD:
  - Toolchain checked before pinning (§0.3 rule 1). Node v24.18.0, pnpm 9.15.9, Docker 29.5.3.
  - Versions pinned to the newest release inside each major the PRD fixes in §7.2:
    Next 15.5.25, React 19.2.0, NestJS 11.2.3, Fastify 5.12.3, Prisma 6.19.3, TypeScript 5.9.3,
    Biome 2.5.12, Turborepo 2.10.12, Vitest 4.1.11, Tailwind 4.3.3, BullMQ 5.81.4, zod 4.5.4.
    Newer majors exist (TypeScript 7, Next 16, NestJS 12, Prisma 8, vitest 5) and were NOT taken:
    §7.2 fixes the majors and §0.3 rule 6 says prefer boring. Changing a major needs an ADR.
  - `ai` 7.0.92 + `@ai-sdk/anthropic` 4.0.49 declare peer `zod: ^3.25.76 || ^4.1.8`; zod 4.5.4 satisfies it.
  - Dev Compose ports are shifted off the defaults (Postgres 5434, Redis 6381, MinIO 9002/9003,
    Gotenberg 3002) because this machine already runs other projects' containers on 5432/6379/9000.
  - `pnpm install` prints a node-gyp warning for `ssh2` (an optional native crypto binding pulled in by
    testcontainers). It is optional, the install completes, and testcontainers falls back to pure JS.

### Task 0.2 — `CLAUDE.md` and docs
- Status: DONE
- Evidence:
  ```
  $ wc -l CLAUDE.md
  101 CLAUDE.md                      # limit is 150 (PRD §0 rule 7)

  $ diff <(sed -n '1831,1936p' docs/PRD.md) <(tail -n +11 docs/ADR/0001-editor.md) \
      && echo "VERBATIM MATCH OK"
  VERBATIM MATCH OK — Appendix B copied byte-for-byte

  $ ls docs docs/ADR fixtures/papers
  docs:     ADR  BUILD_LOG.md  CONSISTENCY_REVIEW.md  PHASES.md  PRD.md
  docs/ADR: 0001-editor.md
  fixtures/papers: README.md
  ```
- Notes / deviations from PRD:
  - The two spec files were delivered as `PRD_1.md` and `PHASES.md` at the repo root; moved to
    `docs/PRD.md` and `docs/PHASES.md` so the paths in PHASES.md's own start prompts resolve.
  - `docs/CONSISTENCY_REVIEW.md` is the discrepancy log required by PHASES.md's preamble
    ("the PRD wins and the discrepancy is logged"). It lists 11 places where the PRD contradicts
    itself and PHASES had to pick a side. These need human decisions; none block Phase 0.
  - Added `.gitattributes` with `* text=auto eol=lf`. Reason: this is a Windows checkout and the
    Appendix A prompt files must stay byte-identical to the PRD (§0.3 rule 11); CRLF churn would
    break that.

  ```
- Notes / deviations from PRD:
  - **The real budget is ₹99.67, not the ₹95.8 printed in §11.4. Headroom is ₹0.33, not ₹4.20.**
    Appendix E.1 step 5 and E.2 both require the budget to be *derived* from `plans.ts` × `pricing.ts`
    rather than read off the §11.2 ₹ column, and the derived unit costs come out above the PRD's
    rounded ones. Per-action, derived vs printed:
    ASSIST 0.1610/0.15 (+7.3%), CITE 0.3393/0.30 (+13.1%), CHAT 0.5133/0.50 (+2.7%),
    DRAFT 2.7144/2.50 (+8.6%), COMMAND 1.2789/1.20 (+6.6%), COHERENCE 5.8725/6.00 (-2.1%),
    EXTRACT 5.742/5.70, OUTLINE 4.176/4.00, STYLE 1.305/1.30, EMBED 0.522/0.50.
    The check still passes, but any upward price move breaks the ₹100 ceiling immediately.
    Appendix E.4 lists the levers; turning `draftModeStrongTier` off is the largest.
    **This needs the owner's attention before the pilot** — it is a real reduction in margin, not a
    rounding quibble.
  - §11.2 prices Assist at "0.15 (0.18 avg incl. cache misses)" and §11.4 bills 0.18. A prompt cache
    is written once per session and read many times, so the write amortises. That is modelled as
    `pricing.assistCacheMissUplift = 1.12`, applied to Assist only, which is exactly what §11.4 does.
    Applying the same uplift to every cached action instead would total ₹105.85 and fail the ceiling.
    `UNSURE:` whether low-frequency cached actions (10 drafts/month) really achieve a cache hit at
    all, since the provider cache TTL is minutes. If they do not, Draft costs more than modelled here.
    Resolved by the real `cachedInputTokens` numbers in `AiCallLog` once week 4 telemetry runs.
  - PRD §11.3 gives cap rows for six actions; Appendix E.2 demands every `AiAction` have a cap in
    every plan. Both cannot hold (the enum has 14 members). Resolved as PHASES 0.3 directs, with an
    explicit `UNMETERED_ACTIONS` list, and the E.2 test asserts the two lists partition the enum
    exactly. Logged as item 10 in docs/CONSISTENCY_REVIEW.md.
  - §13.3 does not mark `GOOGLE_*`, `RAZORPAY_*` or the email variables optional, but §0.2 says the
    app must refuse to start without a required variable, and Razorpay does not ship until Phase 2
    week 11. Resolved by making them conditionally required: the Google pair and the Razorpay triple
    must be all-set or all-unset, and a mail transport is required only when `NODE_ENV=production`.
    Needs human sign-off (§0.3 rule 4); logged as item 11 in docs/CONSISTENCY_REVIEW.md.
  - `AI_FAST_MODEL`, `AI_STRONG_MODEL` and `AI_EMBED_MODEL` are required with no default, so the app
    cannot start on a guessed model id (§0.3 rule 5). `.env.example` ships them blank on purpose.
  - zod 4 API confirmed by spike before use (§0.3 rule 1): `error.issues`, `ctx.addIssue({code:'custom'})`,
    `z.coerce.number()`, `z.email()`.
- UNSURE: see the cache-hit note above.
